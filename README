=============================
ConvexHull.cpp -  A program to find convex hull of a set of points.
Point.cpp - this represant a 2D Point (have a x and y).
PointSetBinaryOperations.cpp - check validity of the implement of operators in PointSet.cpp.
PointSet.cpp - this represant a set of Point (no duplicat Point).

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
ConvexHull - take data from user and add it to a PointSet, after that he sort this group by angle(accord the 
			 min y if y not enough sort this by x).
			 take only the Point that is not coolinear to other (and if we have a coolinear Point's we take 
			 only the extremity) and put them into stack1, and after that run the algorithem on stack1 and 
			 put the legal Point's into stack2. 
			 sort stack2 accord min x (if x not enough sort this by y), and print stack2.
